# looks like:
# find prime conjugates for 420's prime factorization (2*2*3*5*7)
# then take all the ways of selecting solutions from them
# then for each of these, multiply by -1, 1, i, -i
# (note that 2 is a bit unique)
# ( note that this might be wrong, I haven't completed the video, and also the
#   circle in the problem is shifted, it's not on the origin, its equation is:
#   2N**2 = (x-N)**2 + (y-N)**2
# )
